# Contributing to 'Idris Koans'

## Rules

* Please aim to make commits self contained. Ideally one thing at a time.
* Commit messages should have a brief (less than 73 characters) leading
  sentence. Together with a more detailed description where appropriate.

## Dev Process

For developing the project, we aim to follow the following
[Git Branching Model][]. In this model there are two main branches:

* [**master**][] Reflects the _current_ version of the tutorial inline with the
  _current_ version of Idris on Hackage.
* [**dev**][] Reflects the latest upstream and current state of the tutorial.

All pull requests that are for new additions to the project should go to **dev**
All pull requests that detail fixes to the tutorial that is: grammar, spelling,
and coding mistakes should be submitted to **master**

This might sound complicated but in the long term it makes sense in terms of
release management.
